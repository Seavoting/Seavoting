# Seavoting
 
## project orientation 

Seavoting is a cross-chain decentralized voting system that enables users to achieve cross-chain vote on governance.

## What problems have been solved
At present, various types of DAO organizations choose Snapshot as a general voting tool, but Snapshot still has many shortcomings. One of them is  that it can only be voted off-chain and cannot be executed on-chain, and another problem is that it can only read the data stored in the wallet like the number of tokens rather than read the number of tokens in the smart contract. But many times, governance tokens are mostly distributed in different smart contracts. To solve this problem, Seavoting came into being. With Seavoting, an NFT voting system can be established. In addition to reading the number of governance tokens in the wallet, it can also read the number of corresponding tokens in the specified smart contract in the specified blockchain, and customize different weights in different smart contracts. 

## characteristic

As a decentralized cross-chain voting system, Seavoting has the following primary functions and features:
1. Fully decentralized. Voting is done through on-chain voting.
2. Multiple weights.Votes not only come from the wallet, but also from the contract.
3. Diversity of weight settings. Different weights can be set for different contracts.
4. Cross-chain weight collection. Proposers can set which blockchain the weight comes from.
